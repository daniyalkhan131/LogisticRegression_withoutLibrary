# LogisticRegression_withoutLibrary
The goal is to find the values of the model parameters that maximize the log-likelihood of the training set. You need to choose appropriate hyper parameters, such as the learning rate and the number of iterations, to ensure convergence. Assuming two variables and two classes make a model for binary classification.
